    "But before dealing with the utility chain needed, let's first review the concept of Embeddings and Vector Search and RAG. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Embeddings and Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Azure OpenAI documentation ([HERE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings?tabs=python)), An embedding is a special format of data representation that can be easily utilized by machine learning models and algorithms. The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Vectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are essential for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic Richness**: They convert the semantic meaning of text into mathematical vectors, capturing nuances that simple keyword searches miss. This makes them incredibly powerful for understanding and processing language.\n",
    "- **Human-like Searching**: Searching using vector distances mimics the human approach to finding information based on context and meaning, rather than relying solely on exact word matches.\n",
    "- **Efficiency in Scale**: Vector representations allow for efficient handling and searching of large datasets. By reducing complex text to numerical vectors, algorithms can quickly sift through vast amounts of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding LLM Tokens' Context Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT come with a token limit for each input, which poses a challenge when dealing with lengthy documents or extensive data sets. This limitation restricts the model's ability to understand and generate responses based on the full context of the information provided. It becomes crucial, therefore, to devise strategies that can effectively manage and circumvent this limitation to leverage the full power of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, the solution incorporates several key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Segmenting Documents**: Breaking down large documents into smaller, manageable segments.\n",
    "2. **Vectorization of Chunks**: Converting these segments into vectors, making them compatible with vector-based search techniques.\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Search**: Employing both vector and text search methods to pinpoint the most relevant segments in relation to the query.\n",
    "4. **Optimal Context Provision**: Presenting the LLM with the most pertinent segments, ensuring a balance between detail and brevity to stay within token limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ultimate goal is to rely solely on vector indexes and hybrid searchs (vector + text). While it is possible to manually code parsers with OCR for various file types and develop a scheduler to synchronize data with the index, there is a more efficient alternative: **Azure AI Search has automated chunking strategies and vectorization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that **document segmentation and vectorization have already been completed in AI Azure Search**, as seen in the `ordered_content` dictionary. This pre-processing step simplifies subsequent operations, ensuring rapid response times and adherence to the token limits of the chosen OpenAI model.\n"

       "Based on the provided context, several substances have been mentioned that demonstrate the ability to reduce inflammation in the lungs:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Baicalein**: It is reported to reduce airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and inflammation in experimental models of asthma. Baicalein treatment also reduced TGF-β(1), sub-epithelial fibrosis, and goblet cell metaplasia, as well as significantly reducing 12/15-LOX activity, features of mitochondrial dysfunctions, and apoptosis of bronchial epithelia.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Nitric oxide (NO•)**: Although it is known to have anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties, it is also mentioned to contribute to lung injury in several disease models.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Phospholipid acyl chains and cholesterol**: During pulmonary infections, these can be chemically and enzymatically oxidized, producing complex mixtures of bioactive lipids that have proinflammatory and/or proresolving effects on the lung.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Clarithromycin (CAM)**: This antimicrobial agent and immunomodulator significantly suppressed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced production of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), as well as RSV-induced platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor expression and adhesion of Streptococcus pneumoniae cells to pulmonary epithelial cells.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Punica granatum L. Leaf Extract**: This extract attenuates lung inflammation in mice with acute lung injury by reducing cell accumulation, collagen deposition, and expression of TNF-α and IL-1β in the lung and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF).\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Biochanin A**: A ligand of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) alpha and gamma, found in Trifolium pratense (red clover), has anti-inflammatory properties and could be used as an influenza treatment.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)**: Treatment with MSCs significantly palliated H9N2 avian influenza virus-induced pulmonary inflammation by reducing chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines levels, as well as reducing inflammatory cell recruitment into the lungs.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Indirubin derivatives (E804 and E231)**: These were shown to suppress cytokine production in influenza A virus-infected human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) through MAPKs and STAT3 signaling pathways.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Tanshinone IIA (TIIA)**: This substance attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation, decreased expression of TGF-β1, and reversed production of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and angiotensin-(1-7) in rat lungs.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol**: When used in combination, these were more effective in decreasing airway hyperreactivity and inflammation than either alone in allergen-sensitized, RSV-infected mice.\n",
       "\n",
       "11. **SOCS3-siRNA**: Intranasal treatment with SOCS3-siRNA in a chronic mouse model of asthma led to an improvement in eosinophil count, normalization of hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, and a reduction in lung collagen and mucus secretion.\n",
       "\n",
       "These findings from various studies highlight the potential of different medicines and substances in reducing lung inflammation in the context of various lung diseases and infections."

Additionally, chest irradiation at low doses has been found to protect the lung from inflammation by increasing the percentage of NAMs (nerve- and airway-associated macrophages) producing IL-10, which is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, thus leading to lung protection from inflammation<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.077651\" target=\"_blank\">4</a></sup>. Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi) has been proposed as a potential treatment for lung inflammation.
